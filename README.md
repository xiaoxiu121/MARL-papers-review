# Review And Summary for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning(MARL) Papers
This is a review and summary of papers of multi-agent reinforcement learning based on personal understanding. And it will be continuously updated according to learning progress.   
### Review Papers
* [Cooperative Multi-Agent Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926)  
This paper models the multi-agent learning problem as decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. And it differentiates between the centralized method and the decentralized one.  
This paper establishes policy gradient theorem and compatible function approximations for decentralized multi-agent systems. Resulting actor-critic methods preserve the decentralized control at the execution phase, but can aoso estimate the policy gradient from collective experiences guided by a centralized cirtic at the training phase.
